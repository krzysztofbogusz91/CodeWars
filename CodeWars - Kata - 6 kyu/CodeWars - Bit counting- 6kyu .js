// Write a function that takes an (unsigned) integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number.

// Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

var countBits = function(n) {
  return n.toString(2).split("").filter(a => a !=="0").length;
};
